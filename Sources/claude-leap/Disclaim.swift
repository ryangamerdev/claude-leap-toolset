/// macOS attributes privacy permissions (Accessibility, Screen Recording, …) to the
/// *responsible* process — normally the app that spawned us, i.e. Claude Code — so the
/// permission prompts and System Settings entries are labelled with the parent's name and
/// its grants may not even apply to our binary. `responsibility_spawnattrs_setdisclaim`
/// is the (private, widely used — LLDB, Chromium, Claude Desktop) libSystem call that
/// resets the responsibility chain for a spawned child. Combined with
/// `POSIX_SPAWN_SETEXEC` the child *replaces* this process image, so the pid and the
/// inherited stdio pipes — which is what the MCP transport runs over — survive intact.
///
/// The trade-off is deliberate: disclaiming severs inherited grants, so this app must be
/// granted Accessibility (and Screen Recording) under its own identity, once. Signed with a
/// Developer ID, that grant persists across rebuilds.
///
/// Environment:
/// - `LEAP_DISCLAIMED=1`   set on the re-exec'd process; prevents looping.
/// - `LEAP_NO_DISCLAIM=1`  opt out (e.g. to debug attribution).
